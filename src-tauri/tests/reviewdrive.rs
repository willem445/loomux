//! Integration tests for the engine-driven review driver (#1778 S3/S4).
//!
//! Design note: `doc/design/review-driver.md`. The pure core's own properties
//! are pinned inline in `crates/loomux-engine/src/reviewdrive.rs`; what lives
//! here is everything that needs a **crate boundary** or the registry — the
//! tick's wiring, the interception arms, the tools, and the brief rendering.
//!
//! # Why a new file rather than `tests/orchestration.rs`
//!
//! The plan on #1778 named `tests/orchestration.rs`, and its parenthetical says
//! why: CLAUDE.md constraint 4, integration tests rather than unit tests,
//! because a test executable linking the full lib needs the comctl32-v6
//! manifest `build.rs` embeds through `-tests`-scoped link args. A new
//! integration-test *target* satisfies that identically — the reason is the
//! target kind, not the file name. What a new file also avoids is the
//! end-of-file append conflict CLAUDE.md catalogues on that file: every test
//! block there ends `);` + `}`, so two branches appending to a 33k-line file
//! get that tail matched as common context and each side arrives ending
//! mid-assertion. `tests/mergequeue.rs` is the standing precedent for giving a
//! subsystem its own file, and this subsystem has slices still to land.
//! `tests/smoke.rs` is untouched, per that same constraint.
//!
//! No test here spawns a real agent CLI (constraint 3) or a real `git`/`gh`
//! child.

///
/// That type's doc block used to say a private `_seal` field meant an
/// out-of-range bound "cannot be *spelled* from outside". That was false, and
/// false in the direction that matters: `_seal` blocks a struct **literal**
/// (E0451) and nothing else, while every bound field is `pub` — deliberately,
/// so a caller can read the limits a drive is running against. A caller in
/// another crate can therefore take any clamped value and then assign a wider
/// one into it, which is exactly what the first block below does.
///
/// **It compiles, and that is half the point.** This file is a different crate
/// from `crates/loomux-engine`, so if the seal really did make an out-of-range
/// bound unspellable from outside, this test would not build — the claim it
/// replaces was checkable all along, in the one place nobody looked.
///
/// What is true is stronger, and it is about *reach* rather than spelling: an
/// out-of-range bound **cannot reach a decision**, because `decide` clamps
/// unconditionally and shadows its own binding, so no read below that line sees
/// the argument as passed. The engine's own
/// `a_repo_cannot_raise_invariant_9_by_handing_decide_a_wider_bound` pins that
/// from *inside* the module, where `..DriveLimits::default()` can build the raw
/// value directly. This pins the same property across the crate boundary a real
/// caller sits on, by the only route a real caller has.

/// where a re-bless is a visible diff in the same file as the change that caused
/// it. Deviation stated rather than taken quietly.
