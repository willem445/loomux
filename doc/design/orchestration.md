# Design: native orchestrator / worker agent orchestration

Status: implemented (feat/orchestration). Builds on `doc/plans/mcp-orchestration-backend.md`,
extended with roles, guardrails, git-workflow automation, persistence, and audit.

## Problem

A single agent per repo can't absorb a queue of upcoming work without burning its own
context window. The user wants to hand ideas (or GitHub issues) to a long-lived
**orchestrator** agent that plans, schedules, and delegates to **worker** agents — each in
its own visible loomux pane — with a separate **reviewer** agent per PR, while the human
only gatekeeps final review + merge.

## Principles

1. **Panes, not subagents.** Every agent is a normal `claude` CLI in its own pane so the
   human can watch and steer any of them directly.
2. **Visible prompts.** All inter-agent communication is delivered by *typing into the
   recipient's CLI* (bracketed paste + Enter). What the orchestrator tells a worker looks
   exactly like a user prompt, is steerable, and is captured in the audit log.
3. **Guardrails in the platform, judgment in the prompt.** Loomux enforces hard limits
   (max live agents, pinned worker/reviewer models, group isolation); the orchestrator's
   scheduling judgment (worktree vs branch, serial vs parallel by mergeability) lives in
   its instruction template.
4. **Nothing merges without the human.** Agents open PRs; only the user merges.
5. **Survive restarts.** Claude Code isn't a 24/7 daemon. Durable state = GitHub issues
   (labeled `agent-managed`) + a per-group `state.json` the orchestrator reads/writes via
   MCP tools. Relaunching an orchestrator on the same repo reattaches to that state.

## Architecture

```

        ▲ MCP over HTTP (per-agent token)         │ typed prompts (PTY stdin)
   claude CLIs: orchestrator (opus) · workers (pinned model) · reviewers
```

- **Spawn round-trip** (panes are frontend-owned): MCP `spawn_agent` → registry mints
  agent + token + mcp-config → emits `orch-spawn-request` → frontend opens pane, reports
  `bind_agent(agent_id, pty_id)` → registry unblocks the tool call (mpsc, 20s timeout)
  → kickoff prompt typed into the new pane after a boot delay.
- **Isolation:** tools only see the caller's group. Panes without a token (normal shells,
  unrelated agents) have no access at all. `--strict-mcp-config` keeps workers off the
  user's other MCP servers.
- **Completion signals:** workers call `report(status, summary)` → loomux types
  `[loomux] <name> reports …` into the orchestrator pane (queued if mid-turn) + audits it.
  PTY exit marks the agent dead and notifies the orchestrator the same way.

## Tool surface (MCP)

| tool | orchestrator | worker/reviewer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spawn_agent(name, kind, task, worktree?, branch?)` | ✓ (guardrailed) | ✗ |
| `send_prompt(agent_id, text)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `report(status, summary)` / `message_orchestrator(text)` | ✗ | ✓ |
| `list_agents()` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `get_output(agent_id, lines)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `kill_agent(agent_id)` / `focus_agent(agent_id)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `get_state()` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `set_state(state)` | ✓ | ✗ |

Guardrails enforced by `spawn_agent`: live-agent cap (`max_agents`), model pinned per
kind (`worker_model` / `reviewer_model`), permission mode fixed at group creation
(`acceptEdits` default; full-auto opt-in). Worktree creation reuses `git_worktree_add`.

## Launcher UX

"New agent pane" dialog gains a **Mode** select:

- **Single pane** — unchanged.
- **Multiple panes (N)** — spawns N identical agent panes; a worktree name becomes
  `name-1 … name-N` so each agent gets an isolated worktree. (Secondary request.)
- **Orchestrator + workers** — requires a repository; fields: initial workers (0–6),
  max live agents (1–12), worker model, reviewer model, permissions. Spawns one
  orchestrator pane (badged `ORCH`) plus N idle workers (badged `W`), all sharing a
  group color shown as a header dot + pane accent. Reviewers get `REV`.

## Persistence & resume

Group id is derived from the repo (slug + hash), so relaunching an orchestrator on the
same repo reuses the same state dir: `state.json` (opaque orchestrator-managed queue/
plan/notes) and `audit.jsonl` carry over. The orchestrator template instructs it to
`get_state` at session start and `set_state` + update GitHub issues after every planning
change, keeping issues (label `agent-managed`) the durable source of truth.

## Audit log

`audit.jsonl`, one JSON object per line: every tool call (actor, tool, args, result),
prompt delivery (full text), spawn/bind/exit, state writes. Append-only, human-readable.
Rolls over to `audit.1.jsonl` past 8 MB (one generation kept); full prompt texts land
here, so it grows fast.

**In-app viewer** (`auditview.ts`, `orch_audit` command): every orchestration pane (not
just the orchestrator — the log is per-group and read-only) has an `Alt+A` overlay that
renders the log as a timeline, filterable by actor / action / agent with free-text search
over the detail, and rows expand to show the verbatim prompt/task text. The backend read
(`OrchRegistry::audit_log`) concatenates the rotated generation before the current one so
rotation is invisible to the viewer, parses with a pure, per-line-fault-tolerant
`parse_audit_lines` (a malformed line never sinks the view), and caps to the most recent
`AUDIT_VIEW_LIMIT` (5000) entries to bound the payload against a near-8 MB pair. Live-follow
is frontend polling (`orch_audit` every 1.5 s, sticks to the bottom when the human is
already there) rather than backend event emission: auditing is best-effort and written from
several call sites (including background delivery threads via the free `append_audit`), so a
uniform poll that also absorbs rotation is simpler and more robust than threading an
`AppHandle` through every writer. The overlay reuses the git/task-board floating mechanics
(`.git-overlay`) so it never resizes the PTY — a ConPTY resize repaints and duplicates TUI
frames into scrollback.

## SW-dev process (encoded in templates, not code)

Orchestrator: intake → GitHub issue (`agent-managed` label) → plan → mergeability
assessment (sprawling change ⇒ serialize; independent ⇒ parallel worktrees) → delegate →
monitor → reviewer per PR → findings addressed → high-level completion check → hand to
user for merge. Workers: branch → implement → meaningful unit/functional tests (test
intent, not vacuous passes) → design notes + user docs → commit → push → `gh pr create`
→ report. Reviewers: `gh pr review` with findings → report.

## Validation-round additions (2026-07-03)

- **Init friction / permissions**: agents launch with `--add-dir <group dir>` and
  pre-approved loomux MCP tools so initialization needs no human approvals; the "Auto"
  preset additionally pre-approves `git`/`gh`. Bypass-permissions mode was removed
  entirely — its confirm dialog defaults to "exit", which the typed kickoff would
  accept, killing the pane.
- **Agent CLIs**: groups run either Claude Code or Copilot CLI via per-CLI command
  adapters (`build_agent_command`); the launcher's model suggestions follow the CLI.
  Unknown CLIs fall back to Claude explicitly at group creation, never silently.
- **Concurrent groups per repo**: group ids take the first non-live suffix
  (`base`, `base-2`, …), so parallel orchestrations on one repo never share an
  orchestrator/state, while a relaunch with no live group still resumes `base`'s
  state. Badges carry a group ordinal (`ORCH 2` ↔ `W 2`) plus the accent color.
- **Task board**: structured `tasks.json` per group (statuses queued → in-progress →
  review → pr → human-testing → done, plus blocked; notes; priority order), edited by
  the orchestrator via MCP tools and by the human via the pane overlay (Alt+T); each
  side's edits notify the other, and everything is audited.
- **Per-task sessions**: one task per worker (template-enforced); Claude session ids
  are pre-assigned via `--session-id` and recorded on roster + tasks, so follow-ups
  `spawn_agent(resume_session, cwd)` into the original conversation/workspace.

- **Kickoff readiness + restore (second validation round)**: kickoffs wait for the
  CLI to paint and go quiet instead of a fixed delay (a loaded machine lost a
  reviewer's kickoff to the startup stdin flush); delivery outcomes are audited.
  A durable per-group roster (`agents.json`) maps session ids to roles, marking
  sessions in the browser and enabling full orchestration restore: a dead group's
  orchestrator session relaunches group + MCP identity + task board via
  `resume_orch_session`, resuming the conversation; workers/reviewers rejoin live
  groups the same way.

## Risks / limitations

- Kickoff typing races CLI boot; a fixed delay (4s) + bracketed paste is used. If a
  kickoff is lost the orchestrator can re-`send_prompt` (both are visible in the pane).
- `gh` CLI must be installed/authed for the issue/PR workflow; templates degrade to
  local-only work when it's missing.
- Registry is in-memory: closing loomux orphans no processes (kill_all) but live agents
  don't survive; durable state does. Resuming respawns fresh sessions on the old state.
