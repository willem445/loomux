# Design: native orchestrator / worker agent orchestration

Status: implemented (feat/orchestration). Builds on `doc/plans/mcp-orchestration-backend.md`,
extended with roles, guardrails, git-workflow automation, persistence, and audit.

## Problem

A single agent per repo can't absorb a queue of upcoming work without burning its own
context window. The user wants to hand ideas (or GitHub issues) to a long-lived
**orchestrator** agent that plans, schedules, and delegates to **worker** agents — each in
its own visible loomux pane — with a separate **reviewer** agent per PR, while the human
only gatekeeps final review + merge.

## Principles

1. **Panes, not subagents.** Every agent is a normal `claude` CLI in its own pane so the
   human can watch and steer any of them directly.
2. **Visible prompts.** All inter-agent communication is delivered by *typing into the
   recipient's CLI* (bracketed paste + Enter). What the orchestrator tells a worker looks
   exactly like a user prompt, is steerable, and is captured in the audit log.
3. **Guardrails in the platform, judgment in the prompt.** Loomux enforces hard limits
   (max live agents, pinned worker/reviewer models, group isolation); the orchestrator's
   scheduling judgment (worktree vs branch, serial vs parallel by mergeability) lives in
   its instruction template.
4. **Nothing merges without the human.** Agents open PRs; only the user merges.
5. **Survive restarts.** Claude Code isn't a 24/7 daemon. Durable state = GitHub issues
   (labeled `agent-managed`) + a per-group `state.json` the orchestrator reads/writes via
   MCP tools. Relaunching an orchestrator on the same repo reattaches to that state.

## Architecture

```
┌────────────────────────── loomux (Tauri) ──────────────────────────┐

```

- **Spawn round-trip** (panes are frontend-owned): MCP `spawn_agent` → registry mints
  agent + token + mcp-config → emits `orch-spawn-request` → frontend opens pane, reports
  `bind_agent(agent_id, pty_id)` → registry unblocks the tool call (mpsc, 20s timeout)
  → kickoff prompt typed into the new pane after a boot delay.
- **Isolation:** tools only see the caller's group. Panes without a token (normal shells,
  unrelated agents) have no access at all. `--strict-mcp-config` keeps workers off the
  user's other MCP servers.
- **Completion signals:** workers call `report(status, summary)` → loomux types
  `[loomux] <name> reports …` into the orchestrator pane (queued if mid-turn) + audits it.
  PTY exit marks the agent dead and notifies the orchestrator the same way.

## Tool surface (MCP)

| tool | orchestrator | worker/reviewer/planner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spawn_agent(name, kind, task, worktree?, branch?)` | ✓ (guardrailed) | ✗ |
| `send_prompt(agent_id, text)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `report(status, summary)` / `message_orchestrator(text)` | ✗ | ✓ |
| `list_agents()` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `get_output(agent_id, lines)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `kill_agent(agent_id)` / `focus_agent(agent_id)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `get_state()` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `set_state(state)` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `group_usage()` | ✓ | ✗ |

Guardrails enforced by `spawn_agent`: live-agent cap (`max_agents`, counting workers +
reviewers + planners), CLI + model pinned per role (`{role}_cli` / `{role}_model`, see
**Plan agent + mixed agent types** below), permission mode fixed at group creation
(`acceptEdits` default; full-auto opt-in). Worktree creation reuses `git_worktree_add`
(never for a planner — it is read-only).

`kind` is `worker` (default), `reviewer`, or `planner`. A **planner** explores the
codebase read-only and writes a structured implementation plan as a GitHub issue comment,
then reports and exits; it never writes code, branches, worktrees, or PRs.

## Launcher UX

"New agent pane" dialog gains a **Mode** select:

- **Single pane** — unchanged.
- **Multiple panes (N)** — spawns N identical agent panes; a worktree name becomes
  `name-1 … name-N` so each agent gets an isolated worktree. (Secondary request.)
- **Orchestrator + workers** — requires a repository; fields: initial workers (0–6),
  max live agents (1–12), a **per-role CLI + model** row for each of orchestrator /
  worker / reviewer / planner (the top *Agent* select is the group default that seeds
  every role; each role can override it — issue #4), and permissions. Spawns one
  orchestrator pane (badged `ORCH`) plus N idle workers (badged `W`), all sharing a
  group color shown as a header dot + pane accent. Reviewers get `REV`, planners `PLAN`.
  Changing a role's CLI re-populates its model suggestions; every distinct role CLI is
  PATH-checked before launch so a missing CLI fails fast and legibly.

## Persistence & resume

Group id is derived from the repo (slug + hash), so relaunching an orchestrator on the
same repo reuses the same state dir: `state.json` (opaque orchestrator-managed queue/
plan/notes) and `audit.jsonl` carry over. The orchestrator template instructs it to
`get_state` at session start and `set_state` + update GitHub issues after every planning
change, keeping issues (label `agent-managed`) the durable source of truth.

## Audit log

`audit.jsonl`, one JSON object per line: every tool call (actor, tool, args, result),
prompt delivery (full text), spawn/bind/exit, state writes. Append-only, human-readable.
Rolls over to `audit.1.jsonl` past 8 MB (one generation kept); full prompt texts land
here, so it grows fast.

**In-app viewer** (`auditview.ts`, `orch_audit` command): every orchestration pane (not
just the orchestrator — the log is per-group and read-only) has an `Alt+A` overlay that
renders the log as a timeline, filterable by actor / action / agent with free-text search
over the detail, and rows expand to show the verbatim prompt/task text. The backend read
(`OrchRegistry::audit_log`) concatenates the rotated generation before the current one so
rotation is invisible to the viewer, parses with a pure, per-line-fault-tolerant
`parse_audit_lines` (a malformed line never sinks the view), and caps to the most recent
`AUDIT_VIEW_LIMIT` (5000) entries to bound the payload against a near-8 MB pair. Live-follow
is frontend polling (`orch_audit` every 1.5 s, sticks to the bottom when the human is
already there) rather than backend event emission: auditing is best-effort and written from
several call sites (including background delivery threads via the free `append_audit`), so a
uniform poll that also absorbs rotation is simpler and more robust than threading an
`AppHandle` through every writer. The overlay reuses the git/task-board floating mechanics
(`.git-overlay`) so it never resizes the PTY — a ConPTY resize repaints and duplicates TUI
frames into scrollback.

## SW-dev process (encoded in templates, not code)

Orchestrator: intake → GitHub issue (`agent-managed` label) → plan → mergeability
assessment (sprawling change ⇒ serialize; independent ⇒ parallel worktrees) → delegate →
monitor → reviewer per PR → findings addressed → high-level completion check → hand to
user for merge. Workers: branch → implement → meaningful unit/functional tests (test
intent, not vacuous passes) → design notes + user docs → commit → push → `gh pr create`
→ report. Reviewers: `gh pr review` with findings → report.

## Validation-round additions (2026-07-03)

- **Init friction / permissions**: agents launch with `--add-dir <group dir>` and
  pre-approved loomux MCP tools so initialization needs no human approvals; the "Auto"
  preset additionally pre-approves `git`/`gh`. Bypass-permissions mode was removed
  entirely — its confirm dialog defaults to "exit", which the typed kickoff would
  accept, killing the pane.
- **Agent CLIs**: groups run either Claude Code or Copilot CLI via per-CLI command
  adapters (`build_agent_command`); the launcher's model suggestions follow the CLI.
  Unknown CLIs fall back to Claude explicitly at group creation, never silently.
- **Concurrent groups per repo**: group ids take the first non-live suffix
  (`base`, `base-2`, …), so parallel orchestrations on one repo never share an
  orchestrator/state, while a relaunch with no live group still resumes `base`'s
  state. Badges carry a group ordinal (`ORCH 2` ↔ `W 2`) plus the accent color.
- **Task board**: structured `tasks.json` per group (statuses queued → in-progress →
  review → pr → human-testing → done, plus blocked; notes; priority order), edited by
  the orchestrator via MCP tools and by the human via the pane overlay (Alt+T); each
  side's edits notify the other, and everything is audited.
- **Merge-gate actions**: on `pr`/`human-testing` items — the exact point where the
  human gatekeeps — the board overlay exposes the three touchpoints that otherwise
  meant typing into the orchestrator by hand. Issue/PR chips are clickable and open in
  the browser (`orch_open_ref` resolves `#N`/`N`/URL against the repo's `origin` remote:
  `normalize_remote_web_base` + `resolve_ref_url`, both pure/tested; the URL is opened
  via the OS handler as a single argument, never a shell line). **Approve**
  (`orch_approve_task`) marks the item done and types an approval notice into the
  orchestrator to merge; **Request changes** (`orch_request_changes`) collects findings
  in a modal, records them as a board note, and types them to the orchestrator to route
  back to a worker (status stays at the gate). Both go through `upsert_task` (audited,
  actor `human`) and deliver a purpose-built typed notice, staying inside the overlay
  pattern — no PTY resize.
- **Per-task sessions**: one task per worker (template-enforced). Claude session ids are
  pre-assigned via `--session-id`; Copilot mints its own and is tracked post-spawn (see
  "Copilot session tracking" below). Either way the id is recorded on roster + tasks, so
  follow-ups `spawn_agent(resume_session, cwd)` into the original conversation/workspace.

- **Kickoff readiness + restore (second validation round)**: kickoffs wait for the
  CLI to paint and go quiet instead of a fixed delay (a loaded machine lost a
  reviewer's kickoff to the startup stdin flush); delivery outcomes are audited.
  A durable per-group roster (`agents.json`) maps session ids to roles, marking
  sessions in the browser and enabling full orchestration restore: a dead group's
  orchestrator session relaunches group + MCP identity + task board via
  `resume_orch_session`, resuming the conversation; workers/reviewers rejoin live
  groups the same way.

## Cost containment (#7)

Orchestration multiplies *unattended* spend: `max_agents` caps width, not duration, so a
group can quietly burn money for hours. Four guardrails, all in the platform (judgment stays
in the prompt), contain that. The two configurable ones live in `Guardrails`
(`idle_kill_minutes`, `max_spawns_per_hour`), are collected by the launcher (0 = off),
persisted in `group.json`, and clamped in `clamped()`.

- **Per-group pause / resume.** A human-only action (`orch_pause_group` / `orch_resume_group`
  Tauri commands; frontend `pauseGroup`/`resumeGroup`/`groupPaused`). While paused,
  `deliver_prompt` short-circuits *before* touching the pty — every kickoff, orchestrator
  prompt, and worker report is suppressed and audited (`prompt-suppressed-paused`), so agents
  finish their current turn and idle out rather than being killed. Nothing is queued or
  replayed: agents re-sync from the board/state on the next prompt after resume, which is the
  point. The flag is mirrored to a `paused` marker file so a pause survives an app restart
  (re-seeded in `create_group`).
- **Idle-worker auto-kill.** Each worker/reviewer carries `idle_since_ms`, stamped when it is
  spawned without a task or reports `done`/`blocked`, and cleared when the orchestrator sends
  it a prompt (`send_prompt`). A background reaper (`start_idle_reaper`, 30s tick) kills any
  whose idle time crosses the group's `idle_kill_minutes` and notifies the orchestrator so it
  can respawn on demand. The threshold logic is the pure `idle_should_kill`; the orchestrator
  is never a candidate. Off by default (0) — the human opts in, since auto-killing is
  destructive-ish.
- **Per-group cost aggregation.** `group_usage` sums each live pane's session cost into one
  summary (total + per-agent). Cost is parsed best-effort from the pane's in-pane statusline
  (`parse_session_cost` scans the ANSI-stripped tail bottom-up for the freshest `$` figure);
  panes without a visible cost contribute `null` and are excluded from the total. Surfaced
  both to the orchestrator (MCP tool, for status summaries) and the UI (`orch_group_usage`).
- **Spawn-rate limit.** `max_spawns_per_hour` is a runaway-orchestrator backstop: worker/
  reviewer spawns are counted over a rolling hour (`spawn_rate_exceeded`, checked+recorded
  under one lock in `check_and_record_spawn`) and refused past the cap. Only spawns that pass
  the gate are recorded — a refused spawn is not counted, so the cap can't lock a group out;
  a spawn admitted past the gate but later aborted (worktree/bind failure) still counts. The
  orchestrator pane itself (human-launched) is exempt. Off by default (0 = unlimited).

## Copilot session tracking & resume parity (#12)

Claude accepts a pre-assigned `--session-id`, so its per-task session is known and recorded
at spawn. Copilot has `--resume <id>` but **no** way to pin an id up front — it mints one and
writes `~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/workspace.yaml` a few seconds into boot. That gap left
Copilot groups without resumable per-task sessions, session-browser chips, or full restore.
The fix closes it without ever pre-assigning:

- **Baseline + watch.** Just before a Copilot pane's CLI starts, `spawn_agent_ex` snapshots the
  session ids already on disk (`copilot_session_ids`). After the pane binds, a background
  watcher (`spawn_copilot_session_watcher`, 1s poll, 90s budget) looks for a session absent
  from that baseline (`newest_new_copilot_session`). It prefers a session whose recorded `cwd`
  matches the pane's — disambiguating agents spawned concurrently in different worktrees — and
  falls back to the newest fresh session. The `&self` method reaches a background thread via a
  stored `Weak<OrchRegistry>` self-handle (`set_self_arc`), avoiding a self-referential `Arc`.
- **Association.** On discovery, `associate_copilot_session` binds the id to the live pane: the
  agent map (so `list_agents`/resume see it), the durable roster (`agents.json`, which drives
  the session browser and restore), and any task-board item the agent owns. The roster write
  upgrades the pane's spawn-time placeholder (session `None`) in place rather than duplicating
  it. Audited as `copilot-session` (or `copilot-session-untracked` on timeout). The whole path
  honors `COPILOT_HOME`, matching the folder-trust writer, so it is fixture-testable.
- **Parity for free.** Once the id lands on the roster, everything Claude already had works for
  Copilot unchanged: `spawn_agent(resume_session, cwd)` (`--resume <id>`; ids are hex+dashes so
  they pass `sanitize_session`), session-browser restore (`resume_recorded_session`), and the
  ORCH/W/REV chips (derived from `session_roles()`).

Limitation: two Copilot agents started in the *same* cwd at the same instant can't be told
apart by cwd; the newest-session fallback may then bind the wrong one. Distinct worktrees (the
norm for parallel work) avoid this. A Copilot CLI that never writes session-state within 90s is
left untracked (audited), and can still be resumed manually from the session browser once it
does appear.

## Group lifecycle (#8)

Teardown used to mean ✕-clicking panes one at a time. A **group lifecycle panel**
(orchestrator pane header, Alt+O, `GroupView`) collects the whole-group controls in one
overlay — same no-resize overlay mechanics as the git / task / audit views — and sits
alongside the task board and #7's cost figures.

- **Group summary line.** `group_summary` / `orch_group_summary` reports the live-agent
  count, the role breakdown (orch / worker / reviewer / planner), and uptime — per agent and for the
  group as a whole (measured from the earliest-started live agent, i.e. the orchestrator).
  Uptime needs a spawn timestamp, so `AgentEntry` carries `started_ms` (distinct from
  `idle_since_ms`, which is about idleness, not age). The panel polls it every 2s and shows
  each agent's role, name, state (working / ready / idle-for), uptime, and — joined from
  #7's `group_usage` — its session cost, with the group total on the summary line.
- **End orchestration.** `end_group` / `orch_end_group` kills *every* agent in the group,
  the orchestrator included (unlike `kill_agent`, which protects it). It is deliberately a
  Tauri command only — **never** an MCP tool — so it is always human-initiated; the panel
  arms a two-click confirm before firing (destructive, irreversible). The teardown is
  audited as actor `human` (`group-end`, with the killed ids and worktree outcome). An
  optional **remove-worktrees** checkbox additionally reclaims each agent's worktree via
  `git worktree remove --force` (`worktree_cleanup_targets` picks the paths: deduped, and
  never the repo root — removing the user's own checkout would be catastrophic; the branch
  is always kept, only the working copy goes). Already-exited agents' worktrees are
  reclaimed too, since their roster entries still carry the path.
- **Closing the panes.** Killing a pty leaves a dead terminal pane open (agent panes are
  kept-on-error). So after the kill `end_group` emits `orch-group-ended`, which the
  frontend uses to close every pane in the group — the whole point of the action.
- **Composes with pause (#7).** Ending works regardless of pause (delivery suppression
  doesn't block a kill), and it clears the group's `paused` flag and marker file, so a
  later relaunch on the same repo id starts clean instead of silently resuming paused.

## Stalled-agent watchdog (#10)

Silent-agent recovery used to live only in the orchestrator's prompt ("if a spawned agent
stays quiet, `get_output` and re-send"). That is best-effort: a busy or distracted
orchestrator can leave a wedged worker — one whose kickoff was eaten by the boot race, or
that is blocked on an input prompt — burning a pane indefinitely. Loomux already has the
primitives to automate the nudge, so the watchdog does, while leaving the *judgment* (what
to actually do) with the orchestrator.

- **What counts as stalled.** A *working* agent (running worker/reviewer with a task
  assigned, i.e. `idle_since_ms` clear) that has produced **no terminal output and sent no
  report** for the group's `watchdog_stall_minutes`. Output is read from the pty's monotonic
  byte counter (`PtyManager::output_total`, the same counter kickoff-readiness uses), which
  keeps growing even when the output ring saturates — so "did the CLI emit anything since
  last tick?" is a cheap integer compare. Silence is measured from `AgentEntry.last_progress_ms`,
  stamped at spawn and on every activity.
- **Reuses #7's plumbing.** A background loop (`start_watchdog`, 30s tick, mirrors
  `start_idle_reaper`) calls `run_watchdog`, which reads every pane's `output_total`
  (`agent_output_totals`) and hands the snapshot to `watchdog_tick`. Splitting the pty read
  from the decision keeps the stall / anti-nag / pause logic pure and fixture-testable with
  synthetic counters (no threads, no real pane) — the same shape as `reap_idle_agents`.
  The threshold arithmetic is the pure `watchdog_should_notify`; the config knob rides the
  existing `Guardrails` path (collected by the launcher, 0 = off, clamped in `clamped()`,
  persisted in `group.json`). Default **on** (10 min) — unlike idle-kill it is non-destructive.
- **The action.** One typed, audited (`watchdog-stall`) `[loomux]` notice is delivered to the
  orchestrator (`deliver_to_orchestrator`, actor `loomux`) naming the agent and suggesting
  `get_output` + re-send of the kickoff. It is advice, not an action: loomux never touches the
  wedged pane itself.
- **Anti-nag: one notice per stall.** `AgentEntry.watchdog_notified` latches when a notice
  fires and is *cleared* on any fresh sign of life — output growth (seen in `watchdog_tick`),
  a `report` (via `set_agent_idle(false)`'s re-arm), or a `message_orchestrator`
  (`note_agent_activity`). So a genuinely stuck agent is nudged once; one that moves again and
  re-stalls earns a new nudge. Output growth also resets `last_progress_ms`, so the clock only
  ever measures *uninterrupted* silence.
- **Interactions.** A **paused** group (#7) is skipped wholesale: delivery is suppressed there
  anyway, and — the subtle part — we must not spend the one-notice budget while paused, so the
  latch is left untouched and the outstanding stall still earns its first notice on resume
  (regression-tested). **Dead/reaped** agents (idle-kill or exit) are `Dead`/idle and thus
  outside the working-agent filter by construction, so a terminated pane is never flagged. The
  orchestrator is never watchdogged (it is the recipient).

## Attention routing (#6) & interactive-question detection (#40)

The human is the scheduler's bottleneck; attention routing surfaces *which* pane needs
them so they don't scan panes. A background loop (`start_attention`, 3s tick) reads a pty
snapshot and hands it to the pure `attention_tick`, which emits an `AttentionItem` per pane
that needs the human, with a reason in priority order: `blocked` (reported) > `waiting`
(parked on a prompt) > `report` (reported done) > `gate` (the pane's board task sits at a
merge gate). Keeping the policy pure w.r.t. the pty (the pty reads live in
`attention_inputs`) makes the whole thing fixture-testable with synthetic maps — no real
CLI. The frontend routes each item by `pty_id` to `Pane.setAttention`, which paints the
header chip and, via a listener, mirrors the state onto a minimized pane's **dock chip**
(`Grid.renderDock` → `dockChipAttention`) so docking never hides an ask.

- **Scope: every pane, not just agents (#40).** The `waiting` reason applies to *any* live
  pane, including a plain shell the human opened by hand to run a CLI — those have no
  orchestration group/roster identity, so the original agent-only scan never saw them (the
  human's repro: two hand-opened panes running Claude Code / Copilot, both parked on a
  question, no indicator anywhere). `run_attention` now makes two passes: `attention_tick`
  over the roster (all four reasons), then `plain_pane_attention` over every *non-agent* live
  pty (`PtyManager::live_ids`), which raises only `waiting`. Plain-pane items carry just
  `pty_id` (empty `agent_id`/`group`, `role: None`) and are keyed in the shared
  `attn_quiet`/`attn_waiting_ack` maps by a synthetic `pty:<id>` id. The frontend badges **any**
  pane by `pty_id` (the old `orchGroupId` gate is gone); a plain pane acks by pty id
  (`orch_ack_attention_pty`) since it has no agent id. Agent-only surfaces — board-row
  highlight, desktop toasts — stay group-scoped by construction (a plain pane's empty group
  is in no opted-in set), which is the intended split: any blocked CLI lights the pane chip
  and dock dot, while the richer group features remain orchestration-only.

- **The `waiting` heuristic.** A pane is `waiting` when its output has been quiet past
  `ATTENTION_QUIET_MS` (4s), there's been no recent human keystroke, *and* its ANSI-stripped
  tail looks like a live interactive prompt (`prompt_wait_detected`). The quiet + no-keystroke
  gate is what separates a *live* prompt the human must answer from the same words scrolled
  past or a prompt the human is already typing into.
- **#40 — questions weren't detected.** `prompt_wait_detected` originally only fired on a
  selection glyph that *starts* an option line (`starts_with('❯')`), a `1. yes` numbered menu,
  explicit `y/n` tokens, or a fixed list of permission phrasings. Two real interactive-question
  styles slipped through, so the pane chip **and** the dock dot both stayed dark:
  - **Claude Code `AskUserQuestion`** highlights the active option with *reverse-video* (an
    ANSI attribute stripped before detection sees it), leaving numbered options with arbitrary
    labels and no glyph — nothing in the old list matched. Fix: recognize the interactive
    selection-menu **footer** (`enter to select`, `enter to confirm`, `use arrow keys`,
    `↑↓`/`↑/↓`), which survives stripping.
  - **Copilot CLI** draws its `❯` pointer indented inside a bordered box (`│ ❯ Yes`), so the
    option line never *starts* with the pointer after trimming. Fix: strip a line's leading box
    frame / bullet before checking that a `❯`/`›`/`→` pointer *leads* it.
- **Two signal tiers, to avoid a false-positive storm.** The tricky part (#40 review): the two
  new signals are *prose-like* — agents routinely write about keyboard UIs ("use arrow keys…"),
  paste shell prompts (`demo ❯ npm run dev`), and echo `a › b` breadcrumbs, and a *finished*
  agent stays output-quiet with that text in its tail indefinitely, so the quiet gate alone
  does not save them. So the signals are split by how prose-safe each is:
  - *Structured* signals (numbered `y/n` menu, `y/n` tokens, stock permission phrasings) don't
    occur in ordinary prose → honored across the last ~12 lines.
  - *Prose-like* signals — the selection pointer and the plain-English footer — are both read
    **only from the last ~3 non-empty lines** ("the last thing painted"), and the pointer must
    additionally *lead* a de-framed line. A live menu paints its pointer/footer last; a finished
    turn is followed by the CLI's redrawn idle input box, which pushes any pointer/phrase earlier
    in the tail out of range. This is what rules out both a *mid*-line glyph (`demo ❯ npm run
    dev`, a `Home › Prefs` breadcrumb) **and** a *leading* one in finished prose (a `❯ npm run
    dev` repro line, a fenced `❯` command block) above the idle box. The Copilot positive still
    passes on its footer (its boxed pointer sits above the last-3 window); the Claude positive on
    its footer; and a bare inquirer `❯` prompt passes on the pointer when it *is* the last line.
  - Covered by fixtures under `src-tauri/tests/fixtures/attention/`: three positive question
    styles (Claude footer, Copilot footer, bare-pointer-last-line) and **seven** negatives — a
    numbered summary stream, an idle input box, and the five finished-turn-prose repros from the
    review (keyboard-nav prose, mid-line `❯` shell prompt, `›` breadcrumb, leading-`❯` repro
    steps, fenced-`❯` block) — all run through the real `strip_ansi` → `prompt_wait_detected` →
    `attention_tick` path.
- **`waiting` ack is sticky (`attn_waiting_ack`).** `blocked`/`report` latch until acked;
  `waiting` is recomputed live each scan, so without care, focusing a pane whose menu is still
  on screen would clear the chip only to have the next 3s scan re-light it. So acking a pane
  (`ack_attention`, fired when the human turns to it) records it in `attn_waiting_ack`, which
  suppresses `waiting` for that pane **until its output next changes** — i.e. the menu was
  answered or the CLI repainted, at which point it re-arms and a genuinely new prompt flags
  again. This makes "turn to a pane → it stops nagging" hold for `waiting` the same way ack
  clears `blocked`/`report`, while still catching a fresh question later.
- **Known limits.** The footer match is per-line, so a footer wrapped across rows in a very
  narrow pane, or a **localized / reworded** footer, won't match — acceptable for now (the
  pointer and structured signals still cover most such cases). The quiet gate is load-bearing:
  a menu that keeps emitting bytes (blinking cursor, live countdown) never goes quiet and so
  never flags; today's targets (static AskUserQuestion / Copilot menus) do go quiet. Anchoring
  the pointer to the last 3 non-empty lines also means a **footer-less** menu whose ❯ sits at
  the top with 3+ options below it is missed until the user arrows down (the pointer re-enters
  the window); real menus ship footers, so this is a safe-direction miss we accept.

## Prompt-collision mutual exclusion: compose strip + typing hold (#43)

**Problem.** Worker reports and orchestrator kickoffs are delivered by bracketed-pasting
into the orchestrator pane's PTY stdin, then pressing Enter (`deliver_prompt`). The CLI's
own input box is a *shared resource*: if the human is mid-sentence in it when a report
arrives, the paste lands inside their half-typed line and the Enter submits the merged
text. A partial guard already existed — `PtyManager::last_user_input_ms` let the *retry*
Enters skip when the human typed after the first submit — but nothing guarded the initial
paste or the first Enter, which is exactly where the corruption happens.

The fix ships two of the reviewed options together: **C** (the structural destination) with
**A** (a cheap backstop). B (focus-aware deferral) and D/E were rejected — see below.

**C — loomux-owned compose strip (structural mutual exclusion).** The orchestrator pane
gets a thin loomux input strip docked under its terminal (frontend `Pane.buildComposeStrip`,
shown only for the `orchestrator` roster role). The human types steering there; on submit,
the frontend calls `orch_steer`, which enqueues the text to the group's orchestrator through
the **same** per-pane serialized delivery path (`deliver_to_orchestrator` → `deliver_prompt`,
guarded by the per-pty `delivery` mutex) that worker reports already use. The PTY's stdin
then has **exactly one writer — loomux** — and every message (yours or a worker's) is
pasted+submitted **atomically** (whole, never interleaved). The CLI's own input box stops
being shared, so by construction your prompt can't be contaminated and can't contaminate a
report. Everything lands in the audit log (`prompt`, `from: human`).

- *Ordering is best-effort, not a strict FIFO guarantee.* The correctness property is
  atomicity — each message lands whole. Order is **not** guaranteed under rapid concurrent
  sends: `deliver_prompt` spawns a thread per delivery that contends for the per-pty `delivery`
  `std::sync::Mutex`, which is not fair/FIFO (SRWLOCK on Windows), so two sub-second sends — or a
  steer racing a report — can acquire the lock out of submission order. Nothing is lost or
  corrupted (mutual exclusion still holds); only the relative order of near-simultaneous
  messages may flip. A strict arrival sequence would mean threading a monotonic seq/queue
  through the shared `deliver_prompt` hot path (used by *every* delivery source — kickoffs,
  reports, watchdog nudges, steer); not worth it for a low-impact reorder window the human can
  avoid by letting one message land (visible in the pane) before sending a dependent correction.

- *Keyboard routing.* The strip is a plain DOM input, **not** part of xterm, so it never
  steals the terminal's keys — keystrokes only reach it while it holds focus. `Alt+P`
  (`focus-compose` in `shortcuts.ts`) or a click focuses it; **Enter** submits; **Esc** hands
  focus back to the terminal. Enter/Esc are ignored while an IME composition is active
  (`isComposing`/keyCode 229) so candidate selection doesn't submit mid-word.
- *No PTY resize.* The strip is fixed chrome built *before* `term.open`/`fit`, so the terminal
  sizes to the reduced height **once** — it is not a toggled overlay, so it never triggers the
  ConPTY resize-repaint that pollutes scrollback (the invariant the git/task/audit overlays
  also respect). The inline error-status line holds this invariant too: its row is a
  **fixed-height slot present from build time** and shown/hidden via `visibility` (not
  `display`), so a rejected-send message never changes `.orch-compose` height — and thus never
  shrinks `.pane-term` into a `resizePty` on the error path.
- *Feedback, never silent loss.* `steer_orchestrator` rejects empty text and — critically — a
  **paused** group up front (a paused group's delivery is silently suppressed, so without this
  the steered message would vanish with no trace), and a dead/absent orchestrator surfaces as
  the "no live orchestrator" delivery error. All three are shown inline under the strip; the
  typed text is restored on failure (unless the human has already started a newer draft) so a
  rejected message isn't lost. Each Enter enqueues one message and the input stays live rather
  than locking while a send is in flight (rapid sends are delivered independently — order
  best-effort per the note above).

**A — typing-aware hold (backstop for direct terminal typing).** Direct typing into the CLI
box remains possible and remains racy, so `deliver_prompt` now holds delivery **before the
paste** and **re-checks right before the first Enter** while the pane has seen a keystroke
within `USER_QUIET_HOLD` (4s), polling until human-quiet, capped at `USER_QUIET_MAX_HOLD`
(90s) so a long compose session can't starve the report queue. The held duration is audited
(`delivery-held-for-user`, with `stage` = `pre-paste`/`pre-enter` and a `capped` flag). This
composes with the pre-existing submit-retry guard, extending it back to cover the two points
that actually corrupt input.

- *Pure decision + exercised loop.* The hold/deadline choice is the pure
  `should_hold_for_user(last_input_ms, now_ms, held, quiet_window, max_hold)` (unit-tested for
  recent-typing, quiet, never-typed, the cap override, the window boundary, and clock-skew
  no-underflow). Per the #40 twice-bitten lesson (a pure fn tested in isolation isn't enough —
  the *wiring* must be exercised), the poll loop that calls it, `hold_until_quiet`, is generic
  over the keystroke source and timings and is integration-tested directly: proceeds-when-quiet,
  caps-so-reports-aren't-starved, and releases-once-the-human-goes-quiet. `wait_for_user_quiet`
  is the thin production wrapper binding it to `PtyManager::last_user_input_ms` and the shipped
  timings.

**Why not B (focus-aware deferral)?** B holds reports while the orchestrator pane is *focused*.
Once C exists, the human's keystrokes go to a loomux widget, not the CLI box, so the shared
resource is gone regardless of focus — B would only add latency (reports delayed while you
merely watch a focused pane) to solve a collision C has already made structurally impossible.
A covers the residual "typed straight into the CLI" case more precisely (on actual keystroke
recency, not focus). **D** (MCP inbox) can't wake an idle CLI turn — a typed prompt is what
does that — and **E** (stash/restore the human's partial input) has no portable primitive and
is destructive/TUI-fragile. So C+A is the whole fix; B is unnecessary for this option.

**Tests.** `steer_*` integration tests cover the guards (empty, paused-feedback, no-live-
orchestrator, unknown group), that a healthy steer reaches delivery, and that steering
resolves to the **orchestrator** (not a same-group worker), is attributed to `human`, and is
audited only under its own group (isolation). Hold-guard tests cover the loop wiring as above.
The live paste/Enter behavior against a real CLI is validated by hand (no real PTY in test
mode), consistent with the rest of `deliver_prompt`.

## Plan agent + mixed agent types (#47, #4)

Two related additions: a **planner** role, and **per-role** agent CLI + model.

- **Planner role.** A fourth `Role::Planner` alongside orchestrator/worker/reviewer,
  spawned through the same `spawn_agent` (`kind: "planner"`) and counting against the
  same `max_agents` delegate cap. Its template (`templates/planner.md`) scopes it to
  read-only exploration: it investigates the codebase and posts a structured plan
  (scope, files, approach, test strategy, risks/mergeability, suggested worker split) as
  a **GitHub issue comment**, `report`s a one-paragraph summary, and exits. It uses the
  shared non-orchestrator tool surface (`report` / `message_orchestrator` + read-only
  `list_agents`/`get_state`/`list_tasks`), so it cannot spawn or steer; the plan comment
  is its only intended durable output, so a planner session stays cheap and its plan
  trustworthy. The orchestrator template encodes the *when*: simple/contained work →
  straight to workers; complex/sprawling/multi-worker work, an uncertain split, or a
  human-requested plan (incl. the `agent-investigate` label) → planner first, and the plan
  feeds the worker briefs.

  **What the read-only contract enforces — structural vs instruction-backed** (the
  distinction matters; earlier drafts overclaimed it as fully structural):
  - *Structural* (mechanical, verified by tests): a planner never gets a **worktree** —
    the spawn cwd logic runs it in `group.repo` even when `worktree: true` is passed; and
    its CLI is launched **read-only** (`build_agent_command(read_only=true)`): on Claude
    `--disallowedTools Edit Write MultiEdit NotebookEdit` plus `Bash(git commit *)` /
    `Bash(git push *)`, on Copilot `--deny-tool write|edit` plus `shell(git commit|push)`
    — deny rules override the allow list / Auto perms on both CLIs. So a planner **cannot
    edit files, commit, or push**, i.e. cannot produce code changes or push a branch.
    (Rule-spelling note: on Claude the `:*` wildcard is valid *only* as a trailing suffix.
    An earlier draft also passed the colon-mid forms `Bash(git commit:*)` / `Bash(git push:*)`
    as redundant spellings; those are **malformed** — Claude Code ignores them *and* prints a
    startup warning, which was the "auto deny rule" flash seen on planner boot. The canonical
    space form is the only spelling now emitted; see the plan-mode decision below.)
  - *Instruction-backed* (the template + kickoff `PLANNER_READONLY_NOTE`, not a sandbox):
    `gh` stays allowed (a planner needs `gh issue comment` for its deliverable), so a
    planner *could* technically run `gh pr create` or create an inert local branch — it is
    told not to, and with commit/push denied such a branch carries nothing. This is a
    deliberate trade (plan-comment-as-deliverable over a full jail), now stated honestly
    rather than presented as an absolute guarantee.

  **Why not the CLI's `plan` permission mode? (the "auto deny rule" flash, #79)** A human
  reviewing the planner's first boot caught a message about an "auto deny rule" and asked
  the obvious question: should the planner spawn in claude's `--permission-mode plan`
  instead of Auto + deny rules, and would plan mode still let it talk to the orchestrator
  over MCP and post its plan via `gh`? Both were investigated against the CLI docs (no live
  agent was spawned — reasoning is from `claude --help` and
  [permission-modes](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes.md) /
  [permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions.md)):
  - **Plan mode would deadlock this planner.** Plan mode is read-only *and* built around an
    **interactive** hand-off: Claude researches, presents a plan, and then *asks the human*
    how to proceed (approve→auto, approve→acceptEdits, keep planning, …). There is **no
    documented non-interactive / auto-approve** path. Our planner pane has **no human** —
    so it would sit forever at the approval prompt. Worse, the two things the planner exists
    to *emit* — the loomux **MCP `report`** and the **`gh issue comment`** plan — are exactly
    the side-effecting calls plan mode holds back until approval (in plan mode "permission
    prompts still apply as they do in Manual mode", and a mutating shell like `gh issue
    comment` is not a read). So plan mode does not just add a prompt; it blocks the
    deliverable. **Copilot's `--plan` / `--mode plan` is the same shape** (an initial mode a
    human reviews before switching to interactive/autopilot), so switching CLIs doesn't buy
    a headless plan mode either.
  - **So the planner keeps Auto + structural deny rules** — which is the *autonomous*
    equivalent of plan mode's intent: read-only research, but free to emit its plan and
    report and then exit without waiting on anyone. To make that hold with **no human in the
    pane**, a `read_only` planner is now launched **unattended regardless of the group's
    `auto_ops`** (`unattended = auto_ops || read_only` in `build_agent_command`): Auto perms
    + a pre-approved `Bash(git *)` / `Bash(gh *)` allowlist so exploration, `gh issue view`,
    and the `gh issue comment` plan never prompt, with `Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit`
    and `git commit`/`git push` denied. Previously a planner in a **non-auto_ops** group got
    `acceptEdits` and *no* git/gh allowlist, so its very first `gh` call would have prompted
    into the void — a latent deadlock this fixes. Workers/reviewers are untouched: without
    `auto_ops` they still gate ops through `acceptEdits`.
  - **The flash itself was ours, not alarming.** It was Claude Code's own startup warning
    for a **malformed** deny rule: we passed both `Bash(git commit:*)` (colon mid-pattern)
    and `Bash(git commit *)`, on the mistaken belief that an unmatched spelling is silently
    inert. It isn't — `:*` is a valid wildcard only as a *trailing* suffix, so the colon-mid
    form is malformed; Claude Code ignores it **and warns at startup**. Dropping the colon-mid
    spellings (keeping the canonical space form, which still enforces) removes the warning at
    its source rather than papering over it. **Direct answers to the human's two questions:**
    (a) No — the planner should *not* use plan mode; it would deadlock a human-less pane and
    block the plan/report. (b) In plan mode it could *not* reliably use the loomux MCP or post
    via `gh` unattended (both are deferred to approval), which is the second reason we keep
    Auto + deny.

- **Per-role CLI + model.** `Guardrails` gains a per-role CLI (`orchestrator_cli`,
  `worker_cli`, `reviewer_cli`, `planner_cli`) and `planner_model`, alongside the existing
  per-role models. `agent_cli` stays as the **group default**: a per-role CLI that is
  empty inherits it, so old `group.json` (and the single-CLI launcher path) keep working
  unchanged. Resolution is centralized in `Guardrails::cli_for(role)` / `model_for(role)`,
  which every spawn site now calls instead of reading `agent_cli` directly — so the
  claude-vs-copilot decisions (session-id pre-assignment, copilot baseline/session watch,
  folder pre-trust, MCP-config shape, command adapter) are made **per agent** rather than
  per group. Model fallbacks follow the role's *effective* CLI (`default_model`: copilot →
  `auto`; on Claude the reasoning roles orchestrator/planner → the strong tier, worker/
  reviewer → the mid tier). All new fields persist additively in `group.json` (coexisting
  with #56's live `max_agents` patch, which only touches that one key), and are read back
  with empty-string defaults so a resume is forward/backward compatible.

- **Enforcement.** The group-default `agent_cli` is still coerced to a supported CLI in
  `clamped()` (legacy path), but per-role CLIs are **validated at spawn** rather than
  coerced: an unsupported per-role CLI (only reachable via a hand-edited `group.json` —
  the launcher offers only supported CLIs) makes `spawn_agent` return an error naming the
  supported set, instead of silently downgrading the role to Claude.

- **Launcher.** "Orchestrator + workers" mode renders a CLI select + model picker per
  role, seeded from the group-default *Agent* select and independently overridable; a
  role's model list follows its own CLI's suggestions (curated list, merged with the CLI's
  own reported models once the availability probe returns). Every distinct role CLI is
  PATH-checked before launch.

- **Prior art.** Pre-existing PR #5 (`feat/agent-profiles`) explored the adjacent idea of
  configurable, per-agent personas loaded from workspace files. This work is implemented
  fresh on the current base (which post-dates #5 by months) and takes a narrower,
  role-based shape — a fixed planner role plus per-role CLI/model — rather than #5's
  free-form profile files; the only thing carried over is the general direction of
  differentiating agents per role. #5's disposition (close vs adapt) is the human's call.

## Risks / limitations

- Kickoff typing races CLI boot; a fixed delay (4s) + bracketed paste is used. If a
  kickoff is lost the orchestrator can re-`send_prompt` (both are visible in the pane).
- Watchdog silence is measured from pty *output*, so an agent that sits in a tight
  redraw/spinner loop (emitting bytes) without making real progress reads as "alive". The
  watchdog catches wholly-silent stalls (lost kickoff, blocked-on-input), not livelocks;
  those remain the orchestrator's / human's call via `get_output`.
- `gh` CLI must be installed/authed for the issue/PR workflow; templates degrade to
  local-only work when it's missing.
- Registry is in-memory: closing loomux orphans no processes (kill_all) but live agents
  don't survive; durable state does. Resuming respawns fresh sessions on the old state.
- The compose strip (#43) makes steering collision-proof, but **direct** typing into the CLI
  box is only protected by the heuristic hold (A): a keystroke landing in the millisecond
  between the quiet-check and the paste, or a human who pauses mid-sentence past the 4s window,
  can still collide. Typing in the strip has no such window. The 90s starvation cap also means
  a marathon uninterrupted typing session eventually gets a report delivered on top of it —
  the cap trades a rare late collision for never starving reports.
