# Session restore (issue #194)

On reopen, loomux can bring back the **whole prior session** — every tab, each
tab's pane layout, and, where possible, the live agent sessions — or start
clean. This note is the architecture of the **data layer** for that: the
persisted schema, the restore decision model, and the per-pane restore policy.
The boot splash, the grid rebuild, and the auto-resume wiring are the wiring
layer (`main.ts`, Phase 4) and are described only where they consume this core.

This extends **project tabs** ([project-tabs.md](project-tabs.md)), which already
persists the tab shells (name / color / order / active / group binding) through
`tabstore.ts` → the opaque `tabs.json` blob. Session restore adds a per-tab
**pane layout tree** and two top-level fields to that same blob — no backend
change, because the blob stays opaque to `uistate.rs`.

## What the schema captures (and deliberately does not)

`tabstore.ts` is the single source of the tab schema. The `tabs.json` blob gains:

- **`schemaVersion`** — bumped to `2`. A pre-#194 file has no version; decode
  reads that as `1`.
- **`restorePref`** — `"ask" | "restore" | "fresh"`. First run is `"ask"`
  (show the splash), then the human's remembered choice.
- per-tab **`layout`** — an optional split tree mirroring `grid.ts`'s
  `GridLayoutNode`, but with serializable **`PersistedPane`** leaves instead of
  live `Pane` objects. Each leaf records only what restore needs:
  `paneKind` (`terminal | agent | orch`), `name`, `cwd`, `command`/`argv`,
  `shellKind`, and a recorded resumable `sessionId`.

What is **never** captured: the live PTY, the terminal buffer/scrollback, or any
geometry. A pane is re-created or resumed from its record; its process history
is gone (the PTY died with the app). This preserves the cost/#78 stance and the
no-resize invariant — capture reads `layoutSnapshot()` (in-memory tree + flex
weights, no geometry) plus `Pane.capture()` (retained launch inputs + live cwd).

### Migration contract — old files load cleanly

Every #194 field is **optional and additive**, so an old `tabs.json` decodes
exactly as before — shells-only, `restorePref` defaulted to `"ask"`,
`schemaVersion` `1`, and **no `layout` key invented** on any tab. `encodeTabs`
also accepts a pre-#194 snapshot *object* (no `restorePref`/`schemaVersion`/
`layout`) unchanged and stamps the current version on write — which is why
`main.ts`'s `tabs.snapshot()` needs no change to keep producing a valid blob.

A malformed `layout` is **fail-safe**: any invalid node (bad pane, unknown kind,
empty or mis-directed split) collapses that tab's **whole** layout to `null`
rather than throwing — the tab then restores as a single fresh shell. This is
the same "degrade, never crash boot" guard the tab decoder already applies to
malformed tab entries. Malformed *scalar* fields inside an otherwise-valid leaf
coerce to `null`/defaults (bad `cwd` → `null`, non-string `argv` element → whole
`argv` `null`, unknown `shellKind` → `null`, bad `weight` → `1`).

## The restore decision — `restoredecision.ts`

`decideRestore(pref, hasSnapshot) → "restore" | "fresh" | "prompt"`. Tiny by
design: the remembered preference decides, except that with **nothing worth
restoring** we always go `"fresh"` — never prompt over an empty session, never
claim to restore a blank state. `hasSnapshot` is computed by `main.ts` from the
decoded blob (at least one tab, with a captured layout worth rebuilding).

| `pref` \ `hasSnapshot` | `false` | `true` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"ask"` | `fresh` | `prompt` (splash) |
| `"restore"` | `fresh` | `restore` |
| `"fresh"` | `fresh` | `fresh` |

## The per-pane restore policy — `panerestore.ts` (the adopted hybrid)

The issue's key insight: **resuming a CLI session re-opens its context but costs
nothing until a prompt is sent.** That makes auto-resume viable for agent panes
without burning credits — but *not* for whole orchestration groups, where a
resumed autonomous orchestrator (#83) can idle-tick and spawn a worker storm
(#78). So the policy is **kind-aware**:

| Pane kind | On restore | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Terminal** | Re-spawn a fresh shell in the recorded cwd + `shellKind` | No session to resume; zero cost; layout/cwd back instantly. |
| **Agent** (has `sessionId`) | **Auto-resume** via `--resume <id>` into the idle TUI; **never** replay a queued prompt | Loads context, spends no credits — the "near-exact state" goal. |
| **Agent** (no `sessionId`) | **Dormant** pane with a Start button, in the same cwd | Best-effort CLIs (copilot/codex/gemini) have no clean resumable id; honest, not silently broken. |
| **Orchestrator / worker / reviewer** (`orch`) | **Dormant** — the human resumes the whole group via the existing `resumeOrchSession` | The one place a resume can actually burn credits; keep the safety stance exactly here. The rule is keyed on **kind, not the presence of an id** — a worker with a session id still stays dormant. |

`planPaneRestore(pane) → RestoreAction` is the per-pane core; `planLayoutRestore`
turns a layout tree into an ordered `RestoreOpenStep[]` — one `grid.openPane`
call each, with `relativeTo` (the index of an earlier step's pane to split from),
`dir`, and a `weights` chain. This is the **reconstructible** plan: a split's
first child stays put as the anchor and its siblings open beside it, so the
direction and the subtree's weights ride on the sibling steps. A flat
`{dir, weight}[]` (an earlier draft) dropped `relativeTo` and split weights, which
made a 2×2 grid and four stacked panes flatten to the *identical* sequence —
unreconstructible. A serialize → `planLayoutRestore` → replay round-trip is now
structure- **and** weight-identical; `test/panerestore.test.ts` proves it with a
pure model of grid's `insertBeside` (and pins that the 2×2 and 4-stack plans
differ). `grid.openPane` resets flex to equal shares as it splits, so `main.ts`
applies the `weights` after building. All three functions are pure and
exhaustively unit-tested.

**The one-line flip.** The plan promised that switching to all-dormant (every
agent gets a Start button, matching the earlier #167 default) is a single-line
change. It is: `export const AUTO_RESUME_AGENTS` in `panerestore.ts`. Set it to
`false` and every agent restores dormant; groups are dormant regardless.

Rejected outright: **re-attaching** to the old PTY (impossible — it died with the
process) and **auto-resume-with-a-replayed-prompt** (would spend credits on boot).

**Orch leaves + the double-spawn contract.** Unlike the earlier plans, `capture()`
*does* serialize orchestration panes (as `paneKind: "orch"`) rather than dropping
them, so the layout keeps its shape — but `planPaneRestore` maps them to
`dormant-group`, which **must spawn nothing**. The group is revived only by the
tab's `groupId` binding through `resumeOrchSession`; if Phase 4's handling of
`dormant-group` ever opened a pane, a subsequent group resume would double-spawn
every worker (the #78 storm). That contract lives on the `RestoreAction`
`dormant-group` variant and must be honored in the Phase 4 rebuild.

## Module map (this phase)

| Piece | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema + validators | `src/tabstore.ts` | `PersistedPane` / `PersistedLayoutNode` / `RestorePref`, versioned encode/decode, the fail-safe layout validator. Unit-tested. |
| Restore decision | `src/restoredecision.ts` | `decideRestore` — restore/fresh/prompt. Unit-tested. |
| Per-pane policy | `src/panerestore.ts` | The adopted hybrid + tree flattening + the all-dormant flip. Unit-tested. |
| Capture getter | `src/pane.ts` | `Pane.capture() → PersistedPane \| null` (null for a setup-state welcome pane); retains launch inputs (`command`/`argv`/`shellKind`/`sessionId`) for it. DOM-coupled → hand-validated. |
| Wiring (Phase 4) | `src/main.ts` | Splash, `hasSnapshot`, layout capture into `snapshot()`, grid rebuild, auto-resume, dormant Start/Resume. |
| Splash overlay (Phase 4) | `src/restoresplash.ts` | Cold-boot "Restore last session?" overlay (thin DOM over `decideRestore`). |
| Counter/markers (Phase 4) | `src/tabcounts.ts` | Pure per-tab live-agent count + live/dormant orchestration markers. Unit-tested. |

`shellKind` is recorded here but the backend spawn plumbing that acts on it lands
in the shell-kinds phase; `sessionId` is populated by the launcher when it spawns
a session-capable CLI (Phase 4). This phase makes both **capturable**.

## Phase 4 — the wiring (this phase)

The data layer above is now driven end to end by `main.ts` and a thin overlay.

**Capture, populated.** `Pane.capture()` already reduced a live pane to a
`PersistedPane`; Phase 4 fills the last gap — the **session id**. The launcher
mints one for a session-capable CLI (Claude only) as `crypto.randomUUID()` — the
webview's Web Crypto, **not** a getrandom crate, so constraint 2 (which governs
`src-tauri` Rust) doesn't apply — appends `--session-id <uuid>` to the command,
and threads the id onto the pane. `Workspace.captureLayout()` walks
`grid.layoutSnapshot()` into a `PersistedLayoutNode` tree (pruning welcome/setup
leaves, collapsing a split that thereby loses a sibling), and `TabManager.snapshot()`
now carries each tab's `layout` plus the remembered `restorePref`. A new grid
`onChange` callback (fired on pane open/close) re-persists and re-renders the tab
strip, so **live panes persist on change and close** — no longer only on tab-level
edits.

**The boot decision.** `main.ts` decodes the blob, computes `hasSnapshot`
(`hasRestorableContent`: ≥1 tab with a layout, a group binding, or simply >1 tab),
and calls `decideRestore(pref, hasSnapshot)`. `prompt` shows `restoresplash.ts` —
Restore / Start fresh, with a *Remember my choice* box that writes the preference
back (unticked keeps it `"ask"`). It's a pure overlay before any tab exists, so it
resizes nothing.

**The rebuild.** For each restored tab, `rebuildLayout` runs
`planLayoutRestore(layout)` and replays each `RestoreOpenStep` into the tab's grid
(`relativeTo` → the anchor pane from an earlier step, `dir` → the split direction),
then calls the new `grid.applyLayoutWeights(layout)` **once** — `openPane`/
`openDormantPane` reset flex to equal shares as they split, so the saved divider
drags are re-applied after the tree exists. The replay matches the pure model in
`test/panerestore.test.ts` (same `insertBeside` semantics), so structure and
weights come back identical.

Per action:

- **spawn-terminal** → `grid.openPane` with the recorded `cwd` + `shellKind`.
- **resume-agent** → `grid.openPane` with `agentResumeCommand(command, argv,
  sessionId)` — the recorded launch line with any `--session-id`/`--resume`
  stripped and `--resume <id>` appended (flags like the autopilot permission flag
  survive; **no prompt is ever appended** — the no-replay rule). The session id is
  re-recorded so a *second* restore resumes identically.
- **dormant-agent** → `grid.openDormantPane` showing a **Start** card that calls
  `pane.startFromDormant(...)` with the recorded command.
- **dormant-group** → `grid.openDormantPane` showing a **Resume group** card. This
  is where the **no-double-spawn contract** is honored: the placeholder spawns
  nothing. Resume looks up the group's recorded orchestrator session
  (`orchSessionRoles`) and revives the whole group through the existing
  `resumeOrchSession` — the *one* path that spawns it — **then** closes the now-
  redundant dormant ORCH placeholders (after the revive added a real pane, so the
  grid never empties). A dormant pane re-captures its record verbatim, so a session
  closed without resuming offers the identical restore next boot.

Every pane rebuilds `background` (no focus theft); the active tab is focused last.
The rebuild runs with a `booting` guard so the many intermediate opens don't each
re-persist — boot persists once at the end.

**Counter + markers.** The tab strip's agent counter was unreliable (it read only
a 4-second backend group poll, so a plain-agent tab showed nothing and a just-
opened group flashed a stray `0`). It now derives from `tabcounts.ts` over the
panes actually open in the tab (`Workspace.paneInfos()` → `Pane.tabPaneInfo()`):
`agents` counts live agent + live orchestration panes; `liveOrch` drives the `⛓`
icon; `dormantOrch` (a bound-but-not-live group, or a dormant ORCH placeholder)
drives the static `ORCH` chip — never both at once. Cost/paused still come from the
poll. The grid `onChange` re-render makes the count immediate, not poll-latent.

**Stranded-form fix (P1 debt).** A welcome form fires its result and is retired,
but an orchestrator launch that threw afterward left the form stranded with a
disabled *Working…* button. `handleWelcomeSubmit` now catches it, toasts the
error, and calls `form.reopenAfterLaunchFailure` (restoring the fired callback and
re-opening the `SubmitLatch`) so the human can fix the cause and retry.
