## Panes

A **pane** is one terminal. Every pane runs a real PTY — a shell, an agent CLI,
or anything else you'd run in a terminal — with full color, escape-sequence, and
wide-character fidelity. Panes can be **named** (`F2`, or double-click the
title) so a wall of agents stays legible.

## The split grid

Loomux arranges panes as a **matrix**, not a lopsided staircase:

- **Split right** (`Ctrl+Shift+E`) adds a pane beside the current one.
- **Split down** (`Ctrl+Shift+O`) adds one below.

Splitting again *in the same direction* adds a sibling column or row, so
repeated splits build an even grid instead of nesting ever-smaller boxes.

Drag the divider between two panes to **resize** them.

### Rearranging without re-splitting

Panes get cramped fast once an orchestrator opens one per agent, so the grid can
be rearranged in place:

- **Drag to reorder or move** — grab a pane by its header and drag it over
  another. A snap preview shows where it will land:
  - drop on the **middle** to *swap* the two panes, or
  - drop on an **edge** (left/right/top/bottom half) to move the pane there,
    re-splitting the target.

  Release to drop, or press `Esc` to cancel. Swapping two equally-sized slots
  never resizes their terminals, so no scrollback is disturbed.
- **Maximize** (`Ctrl+Shift+M` or the ⤢ button) blows one pane up to fill the
  grid; the same shortcut (or the ⤡ restore button) puts it back. The other
  panes are hidden rather than shrunk, so they don't repaint. Maximize is
  **sticky**: when the orchestrator spawns an agent in the background, the new
  pane joins the grid underneath without dropping you out of fullscreen.
- **Minimize** (`Alt+M` or the — button) parks a pane in the **dock** strip at
  the bottom of the grid — it keeps running. Click its chip to bring it back, or
  the chip's ✕ to close it for good.
- **Fold a whole group** — an orchestrator pane has a fold toggle (the stacked
  panes icon) that minimizes *every* worker/reviewer pane in its group to the
  dock at once, leaving just the orchestrator. Click again to restore them all.
  Handy once a big group has opened a pane per agent and you want the screen
  back. (More in the [orchestration guide](orchestration.html).)

> **Why overlays, never re-splits, for the git/issues/board/audit panels:**
> resizing a PTY forces the program inside it to repaint, which pollutes
> scrollback. Loomux's feature panels float *over* the terminal instead, so the
> PTY box never changes size. You'll see this promise repeated across the
> feature pages — it's a core design rule.

## Copy & paste

- **Copy / paste** — `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` (`Ctrl+V` also pastes).
- A CLI running in a pane (e.g. an agent that says "copied to clipboard") copies
  straight to your **system** clipboard too, via OSC 52 — no manual re-select
  needed.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The single source of truth for keybindings is `src/shortcuts.ts` in the repo;
this table mirrors it.

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Split right | `Ctrl+Shift+E` (or ◫ in a pane header) |
| Split down | `Ctrl+Shift+O` (or ⬓) |
| Close pane | `Ctrl+Shift+W` (or ✕) |
| Rename pane | `F2`, or double-click its title |
| Move focus | `Alt+←/→/↑/↓` (or click) |
| Resize panes | drag the divider between them |
| Reorder / move panes | drag a pane by its header |
| Maximize pane | `Ctrl+Shift+M` (or ⤢); same keys restore |
| Minimize pane | `Alt+M` (or —); restore from the dock |
| Session browser | `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or the *sessions* button) |
| Open in editor | `Alt+E` (or the `</>` button in a pane header) |
| Git view | `Alt+G` (or the ⑂ icon) |
| GitHub issues view | `Alt+I` (or the ◉ icon) |
| Voice prompt | `Alt+S` (push-to-talk; `Esc` cancels) |
| Copy / paste | `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` (`Ctrl+V` also pastes) |

Orchestrator panes add a few more (steering strip, task board, audit viewer,
lifecycle panel) — those live in the [orchestration guide](orchestration.html).

## Stack (what a pane actually is)

- **Backend:** Rust + [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) +
  [`portable-pty`](https://crates.io/crates/portable-pty) (WezTerm's PTY layer)
  — real ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS/Linux.
- **Frontend:** [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org) (the emulator VS Code uses) with
  the WebGL renderer + Unicode 11 addon, vanilla TypeScript, Vite. No UI
  framework.

On Windows the installer ships one prebuilt, MIT-licensed runtime — a modern
**ConPTY host** (`conpty.dll` + `OpenConsole.exe`) for clean terminal resize.
Voice input's whisper.cpp runtime is **not** shipped (it would add ~150 MB); it's
an opt-in download covered on the [voice prompts](features/voice-prompts.html) page.
